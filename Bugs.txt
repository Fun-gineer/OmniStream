find magnify / resize listener and reset the collapselist and collapsechat buttons in that callback

Make all the fire icon settings work, pretty up the buttons

Make the multistream button work

ONLY NEED TO CHANGE THE RECENT STREAMS SAVE CONFIGURATION VARIABLE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE FOR YOU ALREADY.

use window.history.pushState(null, null, push); to push selected streams from the list to the url

the $('#favStreams').click only uses the FavoritesString global, might be a good idea to just load this on startup. Check to see if the localStorage favoritesString is set, if not  then run the function to set it (refreshFavoritesString)
should add a basic funtion to run in the startup function sequence that does the above line...

add a cookie to track when refreshFavoritesString has been run, and use it to run the function again every few days or so...

add a viewers count popup

add a selected streams tabbar with names and delete buttons

maybe fix setResizableStreamList()?
