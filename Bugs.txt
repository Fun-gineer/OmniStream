is CListRefreshTimeMinutes actually saved as a cookie and loaded on startup / used?

fix the URL rewriting.... doesnt work when you load a new stream

Make all the fire icon settings work, pretty up the buttons

Make the multistream button work

ONLY NEED TO CHANGE THE RECENT STREAMS SAVE CONFIGURATION VARIABLE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE FOR YOU ALREADY.

the $('#favStreams').click only uses the FavoritesString global, might be a good idea to just load this on startup. Check to see if the localStorage favoritesString is set, if not  then run the function to set it (refreshFavoritesString)
should add a basic funtion to run in the startup function sequence that does the above line...

add a cookie to track when refreshFavoritesString has been run, and use it to run the function again every few days or so...

add a viewers count popup

maybe fix setResizableStreamList()?
